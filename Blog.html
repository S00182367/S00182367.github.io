  <h1>Week One</h1>
  <p>
    I began the week by coming up with a concept for the game i wished to make for my Work Placement Project.
    I had three ideas in mind at the time which where a Platform game, a Kart Racing game or a Yugioh type card game.
    I decided to do a Platform game in the end.I did not really know what I wanted to do, did i want a 3D Platform or 2D Platform game.
    I would have loved to make a 3D game but I decided to do a 2D game as it would be more likely what I would be able to achieve on my own and withing the time limit.
    It would also allow me to add more of the features that I wanted for the game.

  <h1>Week Two</h1>
  <p>
    I began this week with the weekly meeting with Neil. We outlined our ideas for our games and many people has very interesting ideas.
    I decided to do my work placement project on my own and it would be a 2D Platform game.
    After the meeting I spent the week trying out how to best develop the game and what engine in which to use.
    I tried out using Unreal Engine because I really liked the Blueprint type of coding but I discovered that trying to create a 2D game in Unreal is really made far to complicated,
    so I tried out Unity and found it was far better for developing 2D games. 
    My choice was to sacrifice blueprint coding for a easier development experience or chose blueprint coding and have a really hard job with general development. 
    In the end I decided that I would use Unity for this Project.

  <h1>Week Three</h1>
  <p>
  This week I began my development on the story, characters, collectables and power-ups that would be featured in the game.
    I created my main character and the villains and also what the levels would be like and how they would change for each world area.
    I developed what type of power-ups there would be and how they would effect the character.
    How the character would gain those power-ups and how it would effect the main character. 
    I also developed how the enemy's would change with these power-ups and how the power-ups would be used in levels and boss fights.
    I also developed collectables that would affect the characters overall health and power.
    Collectables would also be used for unlocking new areas and eventually the boss door at the end of the world.
    My big inspirations are games like Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.
    I chose these as my inspiration because I grew up with them an love a good collectable platform style game.
