  <h1>Week One</h1>
  <p>
    I began the week by coming up with a concept for the game i wished to make for my Work Placement Project.
    I had three ideas in mind at the time which where a Platform game, a Kart Racing game or a Yugioh type card game.
    I decided to do a Platform game in the end.I did not really know what I wanted to do, did i want a 3D Platform or 2D Platform game.
    I would have loved to make a 3D game but I decided to do a 2D game as it would be more likely what I would be able to achieve on my own and withing the time limit.
    It would also allow me to add more of the features that I wanted for the game.
