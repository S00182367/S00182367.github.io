  <h1>WEEK ONE 26th April – 3rd May</h1>
  <p>
    I began the week by coming up with a concept for the game I wished to make for my Work Placement Project.
    I had three ideas in mind at the time which where a Platform game, a Kart Racing game or a Yugioh type card game.
    I decided to do a Platform game in the end. I did not really know what I wanted to do, did I want a 3D Platform or 2D Platform game.
    I would have loved to make a 3D game, but I decided to do a 2D game as it would be more likely what I would be able to achieve on my own and withing the time limit.
    It would also allow me to add more of the features that I wanted for the game.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK TWO 3rd May – 10th May</h1>
  <p>
    I began this week with the weekly meeting with Neil.
    We outlined our ideas for our games and many people has very interesting ideas. 
    I decided to do my work placement project on my own and it would be a 2D Platform game.
    After the meeting I spent the week trying out how to best develop the game and what engine in which to use. 
    I tried out using Unreal Engine because I really liked the Blueprint type of coding, 
    but I discovered that trying to create a 2D game in Unreal is really made far too complicated, so I tried out Unity and found it was far better for developing 2D games.
    My choice was to sacrifice blueprint coding for an easier development experience or chose blueprint coding and have a hard job with general development.
    In the end I decided that I would use Unity for this Project.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK THREE 10th May – 17th May</h1>
  <p>
    This week I decided to keep a large workbook that would contain all the game ideas, drawings, storylines, level layout and other information.
    I wanted to create this workbook as I found it is my process, I love to have my ideas all in one book that I can look back on as I progress and in the future.
    I bought some graph books as I wanted to create the pixel art in these books making it easier to then create these drawings in a pixel art maker and transfer them to my game.
    I can then also transfer these images to Trello in the future to show my ideas and progress.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK FOUR 17th May – 24th May</h1>
  <p>
    This week I started work on the game and code.
    I knew myself that I am not the best coder, so I decided to investigate some courses that my help me with Unity and different ways of coding within the engine. 
    I found some helpful courses on the website Udemy.
    I decided to purchase some of these courses and will be progressing through them as I progress to the work experience project to help me with the project itself.
    I also found some temporary assets to use while I am just coding out the game and these can be changed in the final weeks once code is working properly.
    Also, my own assets will need to be made first in a pixel art maker.
    I began work on the Player code and used the temporary assets with the Game objects.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK FIVE 24th May – 31st May</h1>
  <p>
    This week I spent working out code for the player character and how I was going to code in improvements to the players overall movement. 
    I wanted to investigate how to make the character animated using Unity and how to make the player move with the animations.
    I looked up ways to do this online and watched some videos to see how I would go about doing this.
    I found some good information on YouTube and FAQs. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK SIX 31st May – 7th June</h1>
  <p>
    This week I began by improving on the Players movement and on the Players jump mechanic.
    I worked on the code and on how the player would jump in terms of gravity and float. 
    I also added components to the Player for it to work within the level.
    I created animations for the player using free assets as I wanted to make sure it worked along with the players movement and to practice the process of animating sprites.
    I built a test level so I could make sure that my Player was working properly within a level environment. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK SEVEN 7th June – 14th June</h1>
  <p>
    This week I did research on how to program the camera and I also l learned about using Parallax scrolling in 2D video games.
    Parallax scrolling is where the background images move past the camara more slowly than the foreground, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D game.
    I introduced this into my test level by using free background assets and tested to make sure that it was working properly.
    I also worked on the camera to make sure that it follows the Player throughout the test level. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK EIGHT 14th June – 21st June</h1>
  <p>
    This week I continued work on the camera and introduced the vertical camera to the project. 
    The vertical camera worked in much the same way as the Horizontal camera except in this case it followed the Player as it jumped up. 
    It also followed the Player as it ascended to higher platforms in the test level. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK NINE 21st June – 28th June</h1>
  <p>
    This week I spent looking into how GitHub pages works and how I was meant to go about creating a blog on the platform.
    I had already been keeping a blog of my own over the weeks using Microsoft word so that I would be able to transfer it over to my GitHub blog once I knew how it works. 
    I found some videos and information on how to use GitHub pages and figured out how to create a blog. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK TEN 28th June – 5th July</h1>
  <p>
    This week I started work on the blog side of the project. 
    I used the research I had done from last week and began a trial version of the blog.
    I wanted to test how it works and how it looks. 
    I began by creating a separate branch for the blog and learn how to edit the blog directly through GitHub using HTML.
    When the web address is put into the search bar the blog shows up. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK ELEVEN 5th July – 12th July</h1>
  <p>
    This week I spent doing some research and designing a few character assets.
    I researched ways in which to develop a health system in unity and how to add new levels to a current game.
    I also spent time looking up different pixel art creation software. 
    I found a lot of people recommended Photoshop, but I wanted a simpler system for this.
    I also wanted a system that was easy to use with Unity so I will continue to test more systems.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK TWELVE 12th July – 19th July</h1>
  <p>
    This week with I started by adding Vertical Parallax to the test levels.
    It work the same way as the Horizontal Parallax except the background moves vertically as the player jumps and ascends the levels Platforms.
    I also added a health system to the game so that the Player has a way of restoring health and losing it.
    I also added some new levels to the project so I can test out transitioning and other mechanics as I moved ahead.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK THIRTEEN 19th July – 26th July</h1>
  <p>
    This week I spent doing more research on more mechanics to introduce to my game.
    I investigated developing the UI system and developing a world map system.
    I also investigated a pickup system and being able to add these to a collection.
    I also investigated developing enemies and how to do damage to these enemies and in turn do damage to the Player.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK FORTHTEEN 26th July – 2nd August</h1>
  <p>
    This week I also spent doing research and testing out code to see if it would work before I added it to my project.
    I tried out different types of coding and following some video guides to see if they would work within my project.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK FIFTEEN 2nd August – 9th August</h1>
  <p>
    This week I developed a lot of things in my project. 
    I created a health UI system, a way for the player to have a few moments of invincibility when damaged.
    I created a way for the Player to be knocked back when damaged.
    I also created different pickup for the Player to collect throughout the levels.
    I added an enemy to the game and a damage system. 
    I also created a test world map that the Player will use to enter different levels as they progress. 
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK SIXTEEN 9th August – 16th August</h1> 
  <p>
    This week I developed a level lock and unlock system, so the player can only progress as they complete each level. 
    I added a way for the Player to continue should they wish to take a break from the game.
    I added moving platforms and switches to the project to add more fun to the levels.
    I also added a new flying enemy and an end boss when the Player has completed all the levels.
    I used free assets for this until I include my own ones. 
  </p>

  <h1>WEEK SEVENTEEN 16th August – 23rd August</h1>
  <p>
    This week I spent creating my own assets.
    I also spent it mapping out what my levels are going to look like and what number of collectables will be in each of the levels and time required to complete.
    I also spent it looking up which store I am going to put the project on and the pros and cons of each store.
  </p>
  
  <h1>WEEK EIGHTTEEN 23rd August – 27th August</h1>
  <p>
    This week I will spent cleaning up my project adding what needs to be added game wise and blog wise.
    I will also use it to prepare what needs to be handed up at 9.00am Friday morning.
    I will use the week just finishing of the last parts of the project and adding the game to the store.
    Decided to use free assets as mine did not blend well with the others.
    Game will be put on itch.io
