  <h1>Week One</h1>
  <p>
    I began the week by coming up with a concept for the game i wished to make for my Work Placement Project.
    I had three ideas in mind at the time which where a Platform game, a Kart Racing game or a Yugioh type card game.
    I decided to do a Platform game in the end.I did not really know what I wanted to do, did i want a 3D Platform or 2D Platform game.
    I would have loved to make a 3D game but I decided to do a 2D game as it would be more likely what I would be able to achieve on my own and withing the time limit.
    It would also allow me to add more of the features that I wanted for the game.

  <h1>Week Two</h1>
  <p>
    I began this week with the weekly meeting with Neil. We outlined our ideas for our games and many people has very interesting ideas.
    I decided to do my work placement project on my own and it would be a 2D Platform game.
    After the meeting I spent the week trying out how to best develop the game and what engine in which to use.
    I tried out using Unreal Engine because I really liked the Blueprint type of coding but I discovered that trying to create a 2D game in Unreal is really made far to complicated,
    so I tried out Unity and found it was far better for developing 2D games. 
    My choice was to sacrifice blueprint coding for a easier development experience or chose blueprint coding and have a really hard job with general development. 
    In the end I decided that I would use Unity for this Project.
